I am making this as a reference to people for how I learn and function best. Just because I learn this way, does not mean you will. However, some of these may help you:

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (with vim bindings) for note taking
- [GPT-4](https://chat.openai.com/?model=gpt-4) or [Claude](https://claude.ai/chats) as my LLM
	- Claude has a cut-off date of early 2023. It is useful for things that have evolved significantly since 2021 (the cut-off date for GPTs)
	- Claude also has a context window of 100k tokens, allowing it to be great for extracting information from long PDFs/documentation
	- I use *custom instructions* with GPT-4. In particualr, I ask for highly technical, nuanced responses. I also ask to use LaTeX for math with two dollar signs.
- [Cody](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/cody) (which uses Claude) to interact and as questions with any Git repository
- [Mathpix](https://mathpix.com/) for LaTeX OCR. This is useful when inputting math into ChatGPT or Obsidian.
- [Noizio](https://noiz.io/) for ambient noise. I prefer brown noise + space drone. Listening to music tends to make it harder for me to get into deep work, as it is distracting to some degree. From my anecdotal observation truly talented people often seem to not be listening to any music / white noise when they are learning. I think music / podcasts can be great for boring tasks, but for learning it hurts me. Apps like Noizio are especially useful in an office environment, as it makes it harder to get distracted by co-workers
- [Super Easy Timer](https://supereasyapps.com/super-easy-timer-presskit) to set timers on my Macbook Pro. It allows natural language input
- [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) for a variety of things. It is essentially a better Spotlight, where each extension is its own React app.
	- [PromptLab](https://promptlab.skaplan.io/) extension to interface with GPT
- [Sessions](https://www.stayinsession.com/) to time breaks. I have not consistently used the pomodoro technique. When I use sessions, I tend to use longer durations of perhaps 1 hour 30 minutes, as it promotes more deep work.
- [Mortality Death Clock](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mortality-death-clock-new/eeedcpdcehnikgkhbobmkjcipjhlbmpn) as my New Tab. I want to live a productive fufilling life. Seeing how old I am and how long I am expected to live reminds me to not be distracted.
- [Distraction Free for YouTube](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/df-tube-distraction-free/mjdepdfccjgcndkmemponafgioodelna) blocks recommended videos and comments
- [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net/en) as my VPN. I use their DNS content blocker settings to block ads.
- [Archive Page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/archive-page/gcaimhkfmliahedmeklebabdgagipbia) to get around paywalls
- [MarkDownload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdownload-markdown-web/pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi?hl=en-GB) to get articles as markdown.
