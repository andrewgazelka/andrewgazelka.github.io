title: "My Tools"
---

This guide serves as a reference for individuals interested in understanding my learning and functioning methods. It's important to note that these methods may not necessarily work for everyone, but they could potentially be beneficial. Here are some tools and techniques I find useful:

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (with vim bindings) is my preferred tool for note-taking.
- I use [GPT-4](https://chat.openai.com/?model=gpt-4) or [Claude](https://claude.ai/chats) as my Language Learning Model (LLM). Claude, with its cut-off date of early 2023, is particularly useful for topics that have significantly evolved since 2021, the cut-off date for GPTs.
	- Claude's context window of 100k tokens makes it excellent for extracting information from lengthy PDFs or documentation.
	- I employ *custom instructions* with GPT-4, requesting highly technical, nuanced responses and using LaTeX for mathematical expressions, denoted by two dollar signs.
- [Cody](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/cody), which utilizes Claude, allows me to interact with and pose questions to any Git repository.
- [Mathpix](https://mathpix.com/) is my go-to for LaTeX OCR, especially when inputting mathematical expressions into ChatGPT or Obsidian.
- I use [Noizio](https://noiz.io/) for ambient noise, favoring a mix of brown noise and space drone. I find music distracting when trying to achieve deep work. Noizio is particularly useful in an office setting to minimize distractions.
- [Super Easy Timer](https://supereasyapps.com/super-easy-timer-presskit) helps me set timers on my MacBook Pro using natural language input.
- [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) is a versatile tool that functions as an improved Spotlight, with each extension operating as its own React app.
	- The [PromptLab](https://promptlab.skaplan.io/) extension interfaces with GPT.
- [Sessions](https://www.stayinsession.com/) helps me time breaks. I don't consistently use the Pomodoro technique, but when I do, I prefer longer durations of around 90 minutes to promote deep work.
- [Mortality Death Clock](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mortality-death-clock-new/eeedcpdcehnikgkhbobmkjcipjhlbmpn) serves as a reminder of my mortality and the importance of living a productive, fulfilling life.
- [Distraction Free for YouTube](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/df-tube-distraction-free/mjdepdfccjgcndkmemponafgioodelna) blocks recommended videos and comments, reducing distractions.
- I use [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net/en) as my VPN, employing their DNS content blocker settings to block ads.
- [Archive Page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/archive-page/gcaimhkfmliahedmeklebabdgagipbia) helps me bypass paywalls.
- [MarkDownload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdownload-markdown-web/pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi?hl=en-GB) allows me to download articles as markdown.
