<!-- Suppose we can discretize time in intervals of the [Planck Time](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/p/Planck+Time), $t_P$. -->
<!-- Making the assumption that our universe is deterministic, we can then think of the state of the universe, $U$, as a state machine, where given step (time) $t$, $U_t = f(U_{t-1})$, where $f$ is The Theory of Everything. -->

<!-- (However, this is not the case TODO: look into non-determinism of the universe, [entry point](https://qr.ae/prps0n), do we have free will?, etc) -->

<!-- Note—again—4 sounds like the company is making _decisions_ that affect the universe, but this is only assuming free will, which we explicitly assumed does not exist. Therefore, we could reword -->
<!-- _4_ as -->

<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \frac{dI_u}{dt} = \frac{dI(U_t)}{dt} - \frac{dI(U'_t)}{dt} -->
<!-- $$ -->

<!-- where $I$ is impact, and $U'$ is an alternate universe where organization $o$ does not exist. Perhaps we arrive at $U'_t$ by the alternative universe having a different transition function $f'$, or from -->
<!-- the initial state of the universe (let's assume we have one because of infinite regression) being $U_0$. -->

<!-- **This is also interesting because if you have an organization $o$ in $U_t$, it might actually make less impact -->
<!-- than if it didn't exist and there was room for organization $o'$ in $U'_t$. Grit is important, but if you can make more of an impact somewhere else, do not keep working for that company** -->

<!-- ## Decisions -->

<!-- What is a _decision_ if it is pre-determined? Many think that humans try to optimize happiness in the long term -->

<!-- - not actually true -->
<!-- - evolution is a function that favors child birth -->
<!-- - but that isn't true -->
<!-- - we are molecules of DNA that optimize for spreading our genes (selfish gene) -->
<!-- - we are just survival of the most adapt genes and their delivery machines they create -->
<!-- - dopamine -->
<!-- - humans create rewards with dopamine -->
<!-- - our machines will tend to give us dopamine when we are more likely to produce genes -->
<!-- - happiness an effect of dopamine (yes)? -->
<!-- - then more happiness is our flawed (because of gay for instance) body thinking we reproduce more -->
<!-- - most people optimize short term happiness Hobbes -->
<!-- - we have other emotions which we try to avoid which optimize birth in addition to happiness -->
<!-- - often this intuition helps us optimize this function better than we could through purely trying to logic (our brain and our emotions are both part of this optimization funciton) -->

<!-- ## Take away -->

<!-- - intuition is important. part of the machine for maximing births along with brain -->

<!-- - optimization wrt births -->
<!-- - traditionally better off means more births -->
<!-- - optimize for revenue/profit (but is this the case most CEOs are psychopaths and stuff) -->
<!-- - better off now means less births -->
<!-- - we aren't all rapists because of social contract stuff -->

<!-- ## Human maximization -->

<!-- We might think of a human as a machine $M$ that tries to maximize offspring. However, this is not true. For instance, take a human who has 100 cousins and dies to save them, losing all chance of offspring. From an -->
<!-- evolutionary perspective, this is still logical. -->

<!-- It is—in fact—not offspring which is optimized, it is in fact survival of the most fit particles. protogenes these -->
<!-- could be compounds that coerced other compounds into itself. In biological systems the most atomic compound -->
<!-- is the gene. Each gene leads to a separate output from protein maker which is a function of -->

<!-- Humans—and other organisms—can be seen as a complex selection machine -->

<!-- ### Alt Universe 1 -->

<!-- - Suppose people who have phenotype $A$ are more likely to increase in percentage of phenotype $A$ -->
<!--   - say for instance people with brown hair are more likely to produce children with brown hair -->
<!--   - also—for instance—people with blond hair do not produce people with brown hair more but are more likely to kill people with brown hair, increasing their percentage so blond is selected -->

<!-- ### Alt Universe 2 -->

<!-- - TODO Cycling between genes -->

<!-- Going one step further -->

<!-- ```rust -->
<!-- enum Base { -->
<!--     A, B, C, D -->
<!-- } -->

<!-- struct Allele<const SIZE: usize> { -->
<!--     code: [Base; SIZE] -->
<!-- } -->

<!-- struct Phenotype { -->
<!--     // hidden -->
<!-- } -->

<!-- struct Protein -->

<!-- trait Gene { -->
<!--     type SIZE: usize; -->
<!--     fn create(allele: Allele<Self::SIZE>) -> Protein -->
<!-- } -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- TODO: how does this work?? does each gene correspond to a protein. -->

<!-- At the atomic scale these are genes -->

<!-- ## Non heterosexuality -->

<!-- - what about flawed machine, i.e., gay -->
<!-- - emulate if our mates were females births -->

<!-- ## value of a company -->

<!-- - then should be seen from everyone as the calculation of how many offspring they can have given the flawed machine -->

<!-- ## Goal -->

<!-- - Define something that a person "decides" to do as what makes them more happy -->
<!--   - happiness is an emotion -->
<!--   - both rational (expect things to occur) and emotional (dopamine) -->
<!--   - Often fufilliment -->

<!-- Can our machine ever do something which makes us less happy? -->

<!-- What about no nut november. -->

<!-- - perhaps struggling. -->
<!-- - In the moment less "happy" -->
<!-- - Expect future happiness -->
<!-- - brain compensates -->

<!-- What about grieving? We would often not take a pill to stop grieving -->

<!-- - perhaps there is a word that is better than happiness... joy. Perhaps that word is fufillment, but fufillment is a word that seems to go for long term -->

<!-- Selection rate $r$. -->

<!-- We are machines -->

<!-- $$ -->
<!-- M \implies -->
<!-- $$ -->

<!-- ## Distancing -->

<!-- - we don't actually think this -->
<!-- - it doesn't even really matter -->

<!-- ## realized value of a given task over time -->

<!-- TODO: -->

<!-- ## Deadlines (extinction of company) -->

<!-- ## Potential deadlines (probablility of extension of company) -->

<!-- ## The Optimization Constraint -->

<!-- ## Maximizing -->

<!-- Give a member of an organization $m$. Logically, it would make sense if that member tries to -->

<!-- ### Maximize Value: $\int_{t=0} ^ {\infty} \text{value} ( \{ \text{task} \ni \text{completed} ( \text{task} ) \} )$ -->
