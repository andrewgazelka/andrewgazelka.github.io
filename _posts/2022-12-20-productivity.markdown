Let us define productivity as *the quantity value gained per unit of time* or

$$
\begin{align}
\text{productivity} = \frac{\text{value}}{\text{time}}
\end{align}
$$

or even more precisely

$$
\begin{align}
\text{productivity}(t) = \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} v(t)
\end{align}
$$

where $v$ is the value gain, and $t$ is the amount of time.

# Measuring value

Suppose we define the state of the universe at some time $t$ as $U_t$.
We can then define a function $V_t(o) = X_o(U_t)$, where $V_t(o)$ is the value of organization $o$, and $X$ is an arbitrary function that gives the value of a given organization, $o$ given a given universe state.

## Potential Measurements for $X_o$

1. **Revenue** of organization $o$ in universe $U_t$ (in a revenue-optimizing firm)
2. **Profit** of organization $o$ in universe $U_t$ (in a profit-optimizing firm)
3. **Quality of Earth** in universe $U_t$. This could be a positive impact on $U_t$ by $o$.
4. **Instantaneous Impact on Earth at time $t$**.

It is important to realize that all except (4) Are non-instantaneous values. This means that even if the company in the universe state $U_t$ no longer exists, it is possible we have still maximized $U_t$.

# Optimization Problem ü§ñ

A na√Øve employee who wants to be productive might prioritize long-term productivity by trying to optimize its value in the universe $V_t(o)$ in the long term. We have:

$$
\lim_{t \to \infty} V_t(o) = \lim_{t \to \infty} X_o(U_t)
$$

Using the previous measurements of $X_o$, we have there exists some definite time step $T$ such that for any $t' \geq T$.

1. $\lim\limits_{t \to \infty} X_o(U_t) = X_o(U_{t'})$ (we have reached a given revenue, and the company no longer exists)
2. $\lim\limits_{t \to \infty} X_o(U_t) = X_o(U_{t'})$ (we have reached a given profit, and the company no longer exists)
3. $\lim\limits_{t \to \infty} X_o(U_t) = X_o(U_{t'}) = 0$ we have reached the heat death of the universe
4. $\lim\limits_{t \to \infty} X_o(U_t) = X_o(U_{t'}) = 0$ the company is no longer impacting the universe

For some of these factors, optimizing for the long term does not make sense as it will always be $0$. Indeed, John Maynard Keynes [is attributed to saying](<(https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/6757924-in-the-long-run-we-are-all-dead-economists-set)>)

> In the long run, we are all dead

**Therefore, it can be useful to focus on the middle term. Perhaps how much value things will have in the next year, decade, or life. The future is dominated by chaos, anyway, and it is hard to predict.**

## Individual Optimization and Alignment

Many humans will try to optimize their position in the company. Let us call the individual $i$.
In an aligned environment, we have

$$
\begin{cases}
\frac{dX_o(U_t)}{dt} > 0 &\text{if} \, \frac{dX_i(U_t)}{dt} > 0\\
\frac{dX_o(U_t)}{dt} < 0 &\text{if} \, \frac{dX_i(U_t)}{dt} < 0\\
\end{cases}
$$

and in a _highly_ aligned organization the moves made by $i$ will maximize both $X_i(U_t)$ and $X_o(U_t)$.

# Implementing with Notion ‚úç

Let us make a [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) table with a **value** and **time** column, and **priority** column where we use equation (1) for priority.

![TODO1](/assets/TODO1.png)

## Exponential Rating

We will use Fibonacci Numbers for value and priority.

```text
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610
```

This is because the growth rate of Fibonacci numbers is [approximately exponential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_Fibonacci_sequence#:~:text=Growth%20rate,-Johannes%20Kepler%20discovered&text=It%20demonstrates%20that%20the%20Fibonacci,is%20the%20number%20of%20factors.) (grows at the golden number).
For some things‚Äîand from my experience‚Äîwe tend to be better at thinking in terms of exponential/logarithmic terms than
in linear. [We do this for sound, for instance](https://www.audiocheck.net/soundtests_nonlinear.php).
Values and time being discretized to roughly exponential numbers force us to find the true value or priority of
a task, not the human-perceived "log" of value or priority.

## Rounding

The provided image uses rounding.
However, this will not be useful if we have $\text{time} > \text{value}$, as we will either get a $1$ or $0$, which
is not useful for sorting. To correct this, we can multiply by `100` beforehand.

![TODO2](/assets/TODO2.png)

## Deadlines
The current priority of a task assumes we have an infinite time to complete each task. However, this is not usually accurate because a due date is imposed. Even if an organization does not impose one on the individual, the organization itself might have one imposed on them by an investor.

Therefore, we will add another column: `Due`.
We can then create another column Called `T-` which includes the number of days until the task is due.

Suppose we have a task that has a priority of $1$ when not considering the due date. Let us call the updated formula
for priority $\text{priority}' = p'$. Let us have a few qualifications:

1. `p'` grows as `T-` decreases
2. `p'` grows faster `T-` decreases
3. `T- >> 0` we want $p' = p$
4. When `T- = 1` we want $p'$ to be MUCH larger than when `T- >> 0`
5. When `T- = 0` we want $p'$ to be MUCH larger than when `T- = 1`

A good candidate would be an exponential function

$$
p' = p\left(ae^{bx +c } + d\right)
$$

where $x$ is `T-`.

Let us start with $b$ = $-1$, $a = 1$, $c = 0$, $d = 1$. We have

$$
\begin{align}
p' = p(e^{-x} + 1)
\end{align}
$$

This meets requirements one through three. However, this does not meet requirements four and five. Let us make
$c = 3$, i.e., things will really start getting magnified when something is due in 3 days.

$$
\begin{align}
p = p(e^{-x + 3} + 1)
\end{align}
$$

When

- $x = 0$, we have $p \approx 21p$
- $x = 1$, we have $p \approx 8p$
- $x = 2$, we have $p \approx 4p$
- $x = 3$, we have $p \approx 2p$
- $x = 4$, we have $p \approx 1.3p$

We can use formulas (1) and (4) to get

$$
\begin{align}
v' = v'(e^{-x + 3} + 1)
\end{align},
$$
where $v$ is value and $v'$ is modified value.

To make something due at 5 PM (i.e., 17:00), we can have the formula:

```javascript
prop("Deadline") ? (dateBetween(prop("Deadline"), now(), "hours") + 17) / 24 : 100
```

And for $v'$ we have
```javascript
round(prop("SimpleValue") * (pow(e, -prop("T-") + 3) + 1))
```

![TODO3](/assets/TODO3.png)

## Task Duration

As [@wffirilat](https://github.com/wffirilat) mentioned to me, the number `3` is somewhat arbitrary. It can instead be helpful to mark the number of times a task takes

Let us add a new field `ETA` which is the estimated time the task will be in days.

We can then create a field `Conservative ETA`, which is `ETA * 1.5` and have `Value` equivalent to. However, we already have a time field‚Äîlet us change `Time` from arbitrary `Time` to `Hours`.

```javascript
round(prop("SimpleValue") * (pow(e, -prop("T-") + prop("Time") * 2 / 24) + 1))
```

## Dependent and Blocking tasks

Suppose we have task $A$ that blocks task $B$. Let us have the following considerations, where 
$p_t$ is the original priority of task $t$, and $p'_t$ is the priority of task $t$ when adjusted for blocking
tasks

1. If $p_B$ is high, then $p'_A \gg p_A$
2. If $p_B$ is zero, then $p'_A = p_A$

However, this gets confusing. If we have a million tasks with priory 0.1, it is hard to think of a formula that will not make the $p_A$ priority super high.

Instead, let us think in terms of super tasks:

Let us denote $v_t$ as the value of task $t$ and $v'_t$ as the value of completing the super task, where a super task is that task and tasks which block it. 

In the example scenario, we have

$$
v'_A = v_A + v_B
$$

or

$$
\begin{align}
v'_t = v_t + \Sigma_{\text{task} \in \text{blocking(t)}} v_\text{task}
\end{align}
$$

if given time $T_t$ is the time to complete task $t$ and $T'$ is the super task time, we have

$$
T'_A = v_A + v_B
$$

or 

$$
\begin{align}
T'_t = T_t + \Sigma_{\text{task} \in \text{blocking(t)}} T_\text{task}
\end{align}
$$

so by (1), we have

$$
\begin{align}
p'_t = \frac{v'_t}{T'_t}
\end{align}
$$

## Useable Implementation

Below is a useable implementation. I have also made some QOL changes, including but not limited to the following:

- `Value` defaults to `3` when not selected
- `Hours` defaults to `3` when not selected
- `Deadline` acts as if it is thousands of days in the future if it is not selected

# Pruning ‚úÇÔ∏è

Suppose we have tasks

- a
- b
- c

Where $p_a > p_b > p_c$. We would think we should do task $a$, then $b$, then $c$. 
However, **if there is no due date for the tasks** and if time and value of a task is order-invariant, at the end of the day the productivity 
gained from doing

- Task A, then B, then C
- Task B, then A, then C
- Task C, then B, then A
- ...

is all the same. 

In this scenario, **the benefit of ranking with priority is we can prune low-priority tasks**.

# Delegation üì© 

- $V$ is value of task before delegation
- $V_d$ is the value of a certain task when delegated
- $t$ is time it will task to do task before delegation
- $t_d$ is time it will take to do task when delegated
- $T$ is the time it will take to transfer the task between the original user and delegation

## $V_d$ and $V$

Assuming the task is done of the same quality

$$
\begin{align}
V_d \leq V
\end{align}
$$

since there can be a cost of delegating which can directly be factored into the value of the task. 

- **Where we measure value at an organization level**: $V_d \approx V$
  - the person who is being delegated to might cost money to hire
- **Where we measure value at an individual level** $V_d \approx 0$
  - the individual will not get credit for the work done. In this case, usually $V_d \approx 0$ or potentially even $V_d < 0$ if it is a task the 
  delegatee thinks the delegator should have done

*Note: that we are not considering opportunity cost, as 
opportunity cost is hard to evaluate and always dynamic based on the current opportunities. Instead, we opt for values to be more static and to only do
tasks which have the highest value.*

As an employee of a company, it is usually a good idea to have your measure of value a combination of organization and strict-individual.

## Organizational Self-Delegation Strategy

We can share the Notion table cross team member

- Since $V_d \approx V$ if we are delegating in the organization (there is no extra contractor who needs to be hired),
we can assume $V = V_d$ so we do not need a separate value column.
- Since we are allowing self-delegation, $T = 0$. 
- The task should be assigned to the user who minimizes $t$ without making them over capacity (TODO: add factor in TODO board for over capacity members).
  - We will make this value $t$ instead of having a separate $t_d$
  - Tasks can be assigned at week-long intervals, so capacity can be a meaningful measure and people can group together to hive-mind time estimates.

# Experimentation / WIP üß™

The sections below still need experimentation 

## Frog Factor (Experimentation Needed)

Mark Twain [is attributed in saying](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/168105-eat-a-live-frog-first-thing-in-the-morning-and):

> Eat a live frog first thing in the morning and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day.

Implying that it can be a good mindset to do the tasks we least enjoy doing first. 
- Logically this makes sense since it makes us avoid procrastination. 
- However, given that our list already gives us the most important (by priority) tasks to do first, will a frog factor increase overall priority
by allowing us to work harder, so we can get to the cake of the more fun tasks later on?

## Alternating Frog (Experimentation Needed)

Perhaps doing the least favorite task of a certain time, do favorite task of a certain duration could be better to achieve more consistent results

## Pomodoro (WIP)

- Doesn't change how tasks are ordered, but might make it so we do not have to use alternating frog
- maybe we could use alternating frog as part of our break instead of pomodoro to remove such frequent breaks and do less frequent breaks

## Personal Optimization (WIP)

- ways to measure yourself and optimize personal method (i.e., pomodoro times)
