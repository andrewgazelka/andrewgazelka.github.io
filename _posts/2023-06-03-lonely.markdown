title: "Unproductive or Lonely"
---


**Am I unproductive because I am so lonely?** I think this is an important question to ask myself. For what reason do I
open up my phone to check iMessage, Snapchat, Email. Is it because I truly *know* that I will benefit from this or is it
because I am lonely.
Because I want someone to care about me...
because I feel I am important if I received an email.

Maybe I need to find a way to just be happier by myself.
Therapists don't want you
to constantly be dependent on them because it is an unhealthy relationship to constantly need to rely on someone else.
For this same reason, I think it is unhealthy to constantly need to rely on other people to make you happy.
Yes, people can make you happy, but requiring people to constantly interact with you to make you happy is not healthy.

My goal this month is to eliminate Instagram by deleting it.
But I realized that this is very hard.
Sometimes I _need_ to use it in order to communicate with people.
For instance, there are a lot of distant friends that I have that I only communicate with through Instagram.
However, I feel this is a much more deliberate use.
Checking instagram once every few hours makes sense, but I believe polling it much more is not healthy.
I think we should take back control of our lives and not have these giant asyncronous conversations that require us
constantly craving affection.
My goal is to only check social media a couple of days,
and if someone needs to talk to me they should be able to just call me.
