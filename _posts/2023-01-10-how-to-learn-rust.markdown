## Starting Out

- Use the [official Rust Discord](https://discord.gg/rust-lang). People usually respond to questions within minutes!
- Read the [official Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- Let the compiler teach you! Work on a personal project. If you can't think of one, [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) is an excellent way to learn more complex Rust patterns.
  - For instance, using linked lists in Rust (prominent in LeetCode) teaches you a lot about **ownership**, one of the essential principles of rust. 
    [Someone made a whole tutorial](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/) related to Linked Lists in Rust. It is excellent for teaching beginners
- Look at the [Rust Blog, aimed at significant Rust developments](https://blog.rust-lang.org/).

## Learning More

- To become a true Rust wizard, you must first learn _the dark arts of Rust_. Introducingâ€”[_The Rustonomicon_](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/)
  - Includes nitty gritty details about Rust.
- Look at the ["Inside" Rust Blog aimed at those who wish to follow along with Rust development](https://blog.rust-lang.org/).
- Look at [Rust RFC Book](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/) for Rust developments.
