# How to Learn Rust

My reccomendations to learn Rust are:

## Starting Out

- Use the [official Rust Discord](https://discord.gg/rust-lang). People normally respond to questions within minutes!
- Read the [official Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- Let the compiler teach you! Work on a personal project. If you can't think of one [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) is a very way to learn more complex Rust patterns
  - For instance, using linked lists in Rust (which are prominent in leetcode) teach you a lot about **ownership** one of the biggest principles of rust. 
    [Someone made a whole tutorial](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/) related to Linked Lists in Rust. It is very good for teaching beginners
- Look at [Rust Blog aimed at major Rust developments](https://blog.rust-lang.org/)
## Learning More

- To become a true Rust wizard, you must first learn _the dark arts of Rust_. Introducingâ€”[_The Rustonomicon_](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/)
  - Covers a lot of the nitty gritty details about Rust.
- Look at ["Inside" Rust Blog aimed at those who wish to follow along with Rust development](https://blog.rust-lang.org/).
