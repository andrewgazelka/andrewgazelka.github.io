_A log of things I've learned and happen to remember on a given day_

_This post covers things that I want to record but are too small for an individual post_

- Melatonin is most useful in small dosages 
  - Start low, go higher
  - For me, .75mg milligrams makes me sleepy
    - [This is similar to the amount our brain typically makes](https://symphonynaturalhealth.com/blogs/blog/melatonin-used-for-more-than-sleep-related-issues-and-why-less-is-more-when-it-comes-to-dose)
  - Lower melatonin is less likely to wake you up in the middle of the night
- iPad Pros (2022) have horrible backlight problems (it is **so** bad)

##### Questions 

Any particular reason why this syntax isn't allowed?
```rust
trait EmbedEngine {
    const SIZE: usize;
    fn embed(input: &str) -> [f64; Self::SIZE];
}
```
i.e., why `SIZE` cannot be associated

##### TODO
- Look into `DeserializeOwned``

```rust
pub trait DeserializeOwned: for<'de> Deserialize<'de> {}
impl<T> DeserializeOwned for T where T: for<'de> Deserialize<'de> {}
```
