# Concurrent Rust Deep Dive

Happy New Year everyone! Welcome to 2023. I do a lot of work using asynchronous programming. I thought it would
be useful to write a post to clear it up for those less familiar with the concept. I think this is specifically
useful because there are quite a few misconceptions and roadblocks that beginners to the topic usually run into.

In the manner of time, I have chosen to pull large portions from other sources. This is because often explanations
others have provided are already sufficient. The main goal of this article is to combine all source materials into a
readable and easy to follow guide.
