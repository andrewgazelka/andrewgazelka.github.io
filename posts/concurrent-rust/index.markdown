# Concurrent Rust Deep Dive

{:.warning}
This article is currently a WIP. Certain pages are not finished and often contain many TODOs.

{:.warning}
I have played around with OpenAI [edit](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/completion/editing-text) and [insert](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/completion/inserting-text) 
APIs for small but significant portions of the article. I have edited and reviewed the information, but it is totally possible I have missed a few things which are not entirely correct.

Happy New Year everyone! Welcome to 2023. I do a lot of work using asynchronous programming. I thought it would
be useful to write a post to clear it up for those less familiar with the concept. I think this is specifically
useful because there are quite a few misconceptions and roadblocks that beginners to the topic usually run into.
