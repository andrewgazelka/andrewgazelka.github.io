## Asynchronous

The prefix "aâ€”" denotes something which is not, so asynchronous should be equivalent to _not synchronous_.

## Synchronous

According to [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/synchronous), synchronous means

> happening, existing, or arising at precisely the same time

From these definitions, we can deduce that _asynchronous_ means something that does not occur simultaneously.
[Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/asynchronous) defines _asynchronous_ is a task that is

> not simultaneous or concurrent in time

If you have learned about `async/await` before, this might contradict your beliefs of what asynchronous is. I know it did for me.

It may be executed in parallel, it may happen one second, one minute or several hours later, and T2 may still run when T1 has ended (so to process a result of T2, a new task T3 may be required). In this sense, T1 and T2 are not "occurring at the same time (interval)".

## Concurrent

So even though a definition of asynchronous is _not concurrent_, it might be easier to use the term concurrency in
substitution for when we will normally use _asyncronous_. When using the modern term asyncronous in programming, we generally instead mean _concurrent_.

According to [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/concurrence), concurrence is the:

- the simultaneous occurrence of events.
