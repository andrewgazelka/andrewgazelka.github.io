Structured concurrency was popularized by [Notes on structured concurrency, or: Go statement considered harmful](https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/), which argues that the go statement (which launch `goroutines`â€”Go's implementation of coroutines) is harmful due first and foremost to the fact that

### `AsyncDrop` (structured concurrency)

- [Tokio #1879](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/issues/1879).

> Rusts `async/await` mechanism already provides structured concurrency inside a particular task: By utilizing tools like `select!` or `join!` we can run multiple child-tasks which are constrained to the same lifetime - which is the current scope. This is not possible in Go or Kotlin - which require an explicit child-task to be spawned to achieve the behavior. Therefore, the benefits might be lower.

> Some future combinators also use a custom waker, so they can be more precise about which specific future within the task should be re-polled.

> This is an inaccurate simplification that, admittedly, their own literature has perpetuated. Rust uses informed polling: the resource can wake the scheduler at any time and tell it to poll. When this occurs it is virtually identical to completion-based async (sans some small implementation details).
>
> What informed polling brings to the picture is opportunistic sync: a scheduler may choose to poll before suspending a task. This helps when e.g. there is data already in IO buffers (there often is).
>
> There's also some fancy stuff you can do with informed polling, that you can't with completion (such as stateless informed polling).
>
> Everything else I agree with, especially Pin, but informed polling is really elegant.
