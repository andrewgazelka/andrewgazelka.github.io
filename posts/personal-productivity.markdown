## Time blocking

### [Readable](https://readdle.com/blog/what-is-time-blocking)

Time Blocking is a time management technique used to divide the day into blocks of time dedicated to specific tasks or groups of tasks. It is becoming increasingly popular as it helps individuals manage their time more effectively and maintain a work-life balance. It is a combination of a To-do list and a Calendar schedule and helps people focus on one task at a time and be more productive. Time Blocking can be started by sticking to the schedule and determining when one is most and least productive. Appropriate time should be assigned to each task and breaks should be scheduled regularly. Calendars is an iOS app which can be used to get started with Time Blocking and make one more productive.
